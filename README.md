# RedHook2

An open source script hook for Red Dead Redemption 2.

~~Probably won't be updating this, unless there is demand for it. 3+ Script hooks is probably a bit much and a compatibiltiy nightmare.~~

People have been showing interest so I guess I'll continue :)
Will make a proper readme soon^tm

*Please don't use this for online, even though it's allowed by the license*

## Usage

Launch Red Dead Redemption 2 and open loader.exe.
To install sctipts, create a "scripts" folder in your RDR2 directory and place them in there.
